# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts cryptocurrency price movements using Python and machine learning.  
It combines **finance**, **data science**, and **time-series modeling** to explore future price trends.

---

## 📌 Project Goals
- Load and clean historical crypto price data.
- Engineer financial features (moving averages, volatility, etc.).
- Train ML models to predict price direction or next-day value.
- Visualize trends and model performance.

---

## 🧠 Techniques & Tools
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **yfinance** or downloaded CSV datasets
- **scikit-learn** ML models
- Regression & classification approaches
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualizations

---

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. Load price dataset  
2. Create indicators (MA5, MA10, RSI, returns)  
3. Train ML model (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost, linear regression)  
4. Evaluate prediction accuracy  
5. Plot real vs predicted curves  

---

## 📈 Insights
- Observed correlation between moving averages and price swings.
- Explored volatility-based prediction limitations.
- Learned challenges of noisy financial time-series modeling.

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Add LSTM deep learning models.
- Expand to multiple cryptocurrencies.
- Add a backtesting trading simulation.
